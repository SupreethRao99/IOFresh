   >This device will be user controlled using a user friendly mobile application developed in accordance with this specific device. The mobile application will provide us with         features like Periodic Air Quality Monitoring, ALERTS regarding the Air Quality in its surroundings

User Persona:

Persona 1: Working Professional
    >In today’s day and age we observe that a house is empty for upwards of 10 hours a day and any LPG leakage or toxic gases produced due to fires will not be attended to              immediately. IOFresh’s suite of sensors will report the ongoings in their house in real-time allowing them to take necessary action like alerting emergency services.

Persona 2: Families   
   >IOFresh would be a great addition to people and families that like to entertain. The Air Freshener aspect of IOFresh provides a way to set the atmosphere for a gathering or a     party by infusing the air with pleasant aromas.
