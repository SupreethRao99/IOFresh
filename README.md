# Product Summary:

IOFresh is an IOT based Air Freshener. It comprises a basic Air Freshener which is integrated with an Air Quality monitoring module. This Air Quality module provides us with a standard Air Quality Index and also with the composition of the surrounding air (mainly Carbon Monoxide(CO), Methane(CH4) and LPG) 
This device will be user controlled using a user friendly mobile application developed in accordance with this specific device. The mobile application will provide us with features like Periodic Air Quality Monitoring, ALERTS regarding the Air Quality in its surroundings

# User Persona:
## Persona 1: Working Professional
In today’s day and age we observe that a house is empty for upwards of 10 hours a day and any LPG leakage or toxic gases produced due to fires will not be attended to immediately. IOFresh’s suite of sensors will report the ongoings in their house in real-time allowing them to take necessary action like alerting emergency services.

## Persona 2: Families   
IOFresh would be a great addition to people and families that like to entertain. The Air Freshener aspect of IOFresh provides a way to set the atmosphere for a gathering or a party by infusing the air with pleasant aromas.
